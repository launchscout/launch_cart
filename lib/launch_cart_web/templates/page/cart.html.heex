                Customization is entirely up to you. Because Launch Elements uses custom HTML elements, you hold the power. You can style each element using CSS, just like the rest of your site, or use the styles it's shipped withâ€”dealer's choice!

            <h2>Built on top of Live State with custom HTML elements</h2>
            <p>
                Launch Elements is built using custom HTML elements and Live State. Live State is an Elixir library that allows developers to create real-time experiences without dictating a choice of front end technology or hosting environment. What does that mean for you? No matter what language your site is built on or where it is hosted, you can capitalize on the power of Launch Elements.
